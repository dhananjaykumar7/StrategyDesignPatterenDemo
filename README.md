The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to vary the behavior of a workflow at runtime by encapsulating different algorithms within interchangeable strategies.

But why should we use it? That is because we must always try to adhere to the S.O.L.I.D principle while trying to design our application as it enhances maintainability, flexibility, and scalability, promoting clean, modular code design and easier testing and debugging.
