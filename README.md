# StrategyDesignPatterenDemo
The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows us to vary the behavior of a workflow at runtime by encapsulating different algorithms within interchangeable strategies.

But why should we use it? That is because we must always try to adhere to the S.O.L.I.D principle while trying to design our application as it enhances maintainability, flexibility, and scalability, promoting clean, modular code design and easier testing and debugging.


1. What is the **Proxy Pattern**?
✔ A Proxy is an intermediary between the client and the real object.
✔ Controls access to the real object.
✔ Improves performance with caching.
✔ Adds security by restricting unauthorized access.


2. Real-World Example: Database Access Proxy with Caching
Imagine we have a ProductService that fetches product details from the database. We’ll use the Proxy Pattern to:

Cache frequently accessed products to reduce database load.
Restrict unauthorized access to product details.

****Builder Design Pattern**
Use Case: Creating a User Profile in a Large-Scale Application
In a real-world application, especially in enterprise-level applications, creating objects with optional parameters can be complex. Using constructors with multiple parameters can lead to code readability issues and maintenance problems. The Builder Pattern provides a flexible and readable way to construct complex objects.

The Builder Design Pattern is ideal for:
✔ Creating objects with optional parameters.
✔ Ensuring immutability in objects.
✔ Making object construction more readable and manageable.
